<p><mark>205 GTI/CTI

    Peugeot 205 GTI 1.6
    
    Peugeot 205 CTI
    The 1.6 litre GTI was launched in 1984, and came with a XU5J engine, producing 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp), for the 1987 model year the XU5J received the cylinder head with larger valves thus becoming XU5JA. The new engine was quoted for 115 bhp (86 kW; 117 PS). The 1.9 litre GTI came with an XU9JA engine producing 128 PS (94 kW; 126 hp), although later models with a catalytic converter produce 122 PS (90 kW; 120 hp). Internally these engines are very similar, the main differences on 1.9 litre versions being the longer stroke, oil cooler, and some parts of the fuel injection system. The shorter stroke 1.6 litre engine is famed for being revvy and eager, while the 1.9 litre feels lazier and torquier. Outside the engine bay the main differences between the 1.6 GTI and the 1.9 GTI are half-leather seats (1.9 GTI) vs. cloth seats (1.6 GTI); and disc brakes all-round (1.9 GTI) vs. discs at the front and drum brakes at the back (1.6 GTI); as well as the 14-inch (360 mm) alloy (Speedline SL201) wheels (1.6 GTI) vs. 15-inch (380 mm) (Speedline SL299) alloys (1.9 GTI).
    
    The 205 is still often treated as a benchmark in group car tests of the newest GTI models or equivalent. Peugeot itself has never truly recreated this success in future GTI models, although they came very close with the highly regarded GTI-6 variant of the Peugeot 306. A cabriolet version of the 205, known as the CJ/CT/CTI, was designed and partially assembled by Pininfarina of Italy. The CTI version offered the same plastic arches and wheels as the 1.6 GTI. Some later models incorporated the catalysed 1.9-litre engine.

    The main aesthetic difference between the GTI/CTi versions and other 205 models were the plastic wheel arches and trim, beefier front and rear bumper valances. The shell also underwent some minor changes, including larger wheel arches (to suit the larger wheels on the GTI and CTi), and the suspension was redesigned and sat lower on the GTI with stiffer springs, different wishbones and a drop-linked anti-roll bar.
    
    With the early success of the 205 GTI in Europe, Motor Trend reported in 1984 that Peugeot was seriously considering adding it to its US lineup, even though Peugeot had a more upmarket image in the United States.[citation needed] Nothing ever came of such rumours, however, and any talk of Peugeot expanding its presence in US became moot when the company was forced to pull out in 1991.
    
    Sales of the GTI in the United Kingdom in the early 1990s were badly hit by soaring insurance premiums, brought about by high theft and 'joyriding' of cars of this sort. Increasingly stringent emissions regulations meant the 1.6 GTI went out of production in 1992, while the 1.9-litre was sold for a couple more years thanks to re-engineering of the engine to enable it to work properly with a catalytic converter, which dropped power to 122 PS (90 kW; 120 hp).
    
    In October 2020 Peugeot announced that their heritage brand "l'Aventure Peugeot" would make a factory restoration program for the 205 GTI available in 2021 as part of the company's 210th anniversary celebration.[11] This program is intended to be expanded to other Peugeot (and possibly Citroën) models later, but will begin with the 205 GTI as it is one of the most desirable Peugeot built that is also available in large numbers. The cars will be restored to as-new condition, with certain no longer available parts being made on 3D-printers.[11]

    Special 205 GTI editions
    Peugeot produced a number of limited edition 205 GTI models over the car's life:
    
    Across 1989–1990, 1200 GTIs were made in the then new colours of Miami blue (bright metallic blue) and Sorrento Green (a very dark pearlescent green). The cars were made in an equal mix of 300 blue 1.6 litre, 300 green 1.6 litre, 300 blue 1.9 litre and 300 green 1.9 litre. The cars had a sliding sunroof, power steering and full grey leather interior as standard, together with grey carpets and doorcards. These paint colours were later added to the list of available colours for mainstream models.
    
    
    Peugeot 205 1.9 Gentry
    The Gentry was a limited edition version of the 205, it had 1.6 GTI suspension combined with a detuned 105 bhp (78 kW; 106 PS) 1.9 litre engine (as fitted to export market GTIs such as those for Australia and Switzerland) but with an automatic gearbox. Only 300 models were made in Sorrento Green and Aztec Gold (sometimes called Mayfair Beige). They came with full leather trim and real wood trim, power steering and heated mirrors in the UK, as well as the same body side trims as the GTI – which led to the Gentry often being mistaken for a GTI.
    
    A production run of 200 limited edition 1.9 GTI cars was commenced in 1991 for the Japanese market. Due to a breakdown in trade negotiations the production run ceased at what was believed to be 33 units which were subsequently sold off to the European market. All the cars were in automatic transmission guise, having power steering sunroof and air conditioning as standard. The Japanese edition was easily identifiable by having the raised bonnet normally attributed to the diesel models. Pepperpot alloys and cloth trim were used, more reminiscent of the 1.6 GTI cars.[citation needed]
    
    The Griffe was a special GTI edition for mainland Europe, and was sold in France, Germany and the Netherlands. It was bright green (called 'Laser' Green or 'Vert Fluorite'[12]), and came equipped with all available vendor options at that time except air-conditioning, but including full black leather interior, ABS, power steering and sunroof. 1652 Griffes were made, all in laser green and with grey alloy wheels with a silver rim.
    
    The 1FM was produced for the UK market in 1992 to coincide with the 25th birthday of BBC Radio 1. Only 25 were made and each car was individually numbered with a small brass plate.[13] The car was black with 'Radio 1FM 25th' bodywork decals, grey Speedline alloy wheels and came with all options fitted as standard, including ABS, air conditioning, full leather interior, remote central locking, catalytic converter and power steering. A bespoke stereo system including a CD changer, CD head unit, amplifier, uprated door speakers and an acoustic rear shelf containing 200W 6x9 speakers was specified by Clarion. One was raffled at a Radio 1 event, and Radio 1 ran a competition on air to win one</mark></p>
